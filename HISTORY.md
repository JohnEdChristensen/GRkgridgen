# Revision History

## 0.0.2

- Added the testing_codes dir. This directory contains the brute force
  fortran code that is being used to test how large of an volume
  factor we can generate the srHNFs in a given time is and to
  determine which volumes matter mast.

- Added the src directory which will contain code designed for future
  distribution.

- Added the nots directory in which we can store notes from
  collaborations. For now I'm including Rod's divisors writeup and the
  history of or dialog with Dr. Campbell.
