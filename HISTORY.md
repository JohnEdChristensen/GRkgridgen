# Revision History

## 0.0.12
- Began implementing the fortran version of the code (created sc, bcc,
  and fcc subroutines).

## 0.0.11
- Implemented faster algorithms for bcc, fcc, sc, and body centered tetragonal cells.
- Fixed integer division in universal.py for python 3.
- Fixed a bug in lat_type.py that was caused by the appearance of
  negative angles from the dot products.
- Fixed jeremey.py. The loop over the grids was indented to far.

## 0.0.10
- Fixed bugs in jeremy.py and in universal.py.
- Added some new unit tests to check for the bugs.
- Added additional supporting info.

## 0.0.9
- Created driver for grid generation src/opf_python/gengrid.py. The
  driver is still incomplete.
- Created new subroutines in universal.py. The first is to find the
  symmetry preserving grids given a lattice and target density. The
  second returns the volume factors that will be used for generating
  the srHNFs. Both subroutines still need work.
- Added number and time scaling plots for face centered cubic and face
  centered orthorhombic.
- Added a module for Jeremy's test to use, jeremy.py.

## 0.0.8
- Fixed some bugs in lat_type.py.
- Impltemented unit tests for lat_type.py

## 0.0.7
- Added python modules for each of the remaining lattice types to the
src/opf_python directory, as well as their unit tests (all modules
agree to with the brute force method for volumes factors of 1 to 500
in the tests except monoclinic lattices which have only been tested on
volumes of 1 to 150 for time reasons).
-Fixed error in notes/body_centered_ortho.nb.
-Added lat_type.py to repo. It's a module that identifies the lattice type.

## 0.0.6
- Added src/python/trig.py to the repo. It finds the srHNFs for the trigonal case.
- Fixed a logic error in the simple, body centered, and face centered
  cubic cases and added the math for the mathematica notebook in the notes for the
  each case.
- Added src/python/stet.py for the simple tetrogonal case as well as a
  mathematica notebook in the notes folder.
- Added a mathematica notebooks for all remaining lattices.
- Added the paper `Space Group Subgroups generated by Sublattice
  Relations` to the notes folder.
- Fixed an infinite loop in trig.py.
- Implemented unit tests on all existing python modules.

## 0.0.5
- Added the 'canonical' parent lattice to the documentation for each crystal class.
- Fixed bugs in the conditions for bcc and fcc. They now find HNFs at
  the correct volumes in the range (1-100).
- Added jupyter-notebook that shows how to identify the lattice type for the code.
- Added plots of the HNF and srHNF scaling the brute force way in
  addition to the notebook that generated the plots.

## 0.0.4
-Renamed the fcc and bcc subroutines so that they are called fcc and
 bcc. Also changed the comments to reflect that change.

## 0.0.3
- Added python code that handles the sc, bcc, and fcc lattices using
  Rod's divisor method.
- Also added an jupyter notebook that shows the timing for the
  generation of the grids for a single determinant at a time. It
  scales really nicely.

## 0.0.2
- Added the testing_codes dir. This directory contains the brute force
  fortran code that is being used to test how large of an volume
  factor we can generate the srHNFs in a given time is and to
  determine which volumes matter mast.
- Added the src directory which will contain code designed for future
  distribution.
- Added the nots directory in which we can store notes from
  collaborations. For now I'm including Rod's divisors writeup and the
  history of or dialog with Dr. Campbell.
